Customer Loyalty Program:
This is a small framework for a custom loyalty program. It keeps track of customer visits, orders, products purchased, and customer referrals for a small business.

This is developed as a final project for CS340, which is a databases course, but the aim is to implement this for a small bakery/restaurant business. 

Initial project submission will be Express/Handlebars.js. But if there is a case of business need, the plan is to refactor and overhaul this to React/Django/SQLite.

To run:
- Clone project to local
- Link it to a mySQL database (change configurations in dbcon.js)
- npm install
- node index.js 
- Runs on local host port 4000. To change, modify index.js with regards to the port.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Still growing in my understanding of fullstack developement, so any tips would be much appreciated!
