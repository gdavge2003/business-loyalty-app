Customer Loyalty Program:
This is a small framework for a custom loyalty program. It keeps track of customer visits, orders, products purchased, and customer referrals for a small business.

This is developed as a final project for a databases course, but the aim is to implement this for a small bakery/restaurant business. 

Initial project submission will be Express/Handlebars.js. Production development aims to overhaul this to React/Django/SQLite.
